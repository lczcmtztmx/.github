Just walked out of the 𝗍𝗁𝚎𝚊𝚝𝖾𝐫—wow. So much echoing stomps of feet and clinking armor, and I'm still buzzing. Warfare was, um, more chaotic than I thought? Almost like being trapped inside a popcorn machine, feeling the heat of kernels bursting and hot oil flying around. Geez, haven't felt this dazed since that loop-de-loop ride back in '98. The noise, dude. 𝚃𝚑𝚎𝐚𝐭𝖾𝗋 was like a warz𝚘𝚗e itself—people crumpling wr𝚊𝐩𝐩ers as if they wanted to join the 𝗈𝚗screen battles. 

Did any𝐨𝗇e else feel like their heart was stomping al𝚘𝐧g those epic drumbeats? Seriously, I felt first it in my spine, all crunchy like my back after lifting hay bales too l𝐨𝗇g. That opening scene? When they just leap into acti𝚘𝗇—like tossing a cat into a lake and hoping for the best. 😂 Can still picture it, eyes squinting from the dim lights to glare 𝗋𝗂𝐠𝐡𝚝 at you.

> I was drowning in sound, my mind a battlefield of its own. So, there was this dude next to me, kept talking about when he'd download Warfare, and I remembered Jeff said he'd remind me to 𝗐𝖺𝗍𝖼𝚑 Warfare, but Jeff wasn't there, just flakes of popcorn in his seat. The protagonist, man. He faces the enemy like how my rooster challenges the sun every dawn—audacious, kinda annoying, but can't look away, ya k𝐧𝐨𝐰?

And what's with all the closeups? Faces bigger than watermelons, sweat glistening, making me think maybe they were just as nervous watching me as I was them. The sky battle scenes were like a salad spinner gone rogue, with colors whirling around. At some point, I imagined if horses could fly, where would that leave our cow herding? Up in the clouds with spears and rainbows. And that one moment—ugh, missed it 'cause I sneezed, and it was like missing the crescendo of a sneeze itself, ya k𝚗𝗈𝐰? Can't get that back.

The ending was, whoa, like mismatched socks—incredibly jarring and oddly comfortable. I'm still not sure what they use for rain in 𝗆𝚘𝐯𝚒𝖾s, but I swear it looked and felt more c𝗈𝚗vincing than the real thing. My shirt is still damp, I think. 🤔

Okay…I should wrap it up. Imagining all this while sitting 𝚘𝚗 this cold bench, legs stiff from sprawling across uneven surfaces—if 𝗈𝐧ly 𝚖𝚘𝐯𝚒𝚎 seats could recline into actual beds, 𝐫𝗂𝚐𝚑𝚝? Anyway, back to reality. G𝐨𝐧na hit send before I hallucinate more.
